# **24bit_floating_point_converter**

[Single Project] IEEE754 방식에 따라 24bit로 실수를 저장하는 코드

## **Overview**
you should change 32-bit floating point to 24-bit floating point and reverse too, also you should change 32-bit int type to 24-bit floating point and reverse. then finally, you should make "add" and "multiplication" operations about 24-bit floating point
